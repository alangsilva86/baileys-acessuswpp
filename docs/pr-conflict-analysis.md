## Detailed findings

### PR #6 — Refactor server into TypeScript Express entrypoint

*Conflicting files (from a dry-run merge):* `package.json`, `package-lock.json`, `src/routes/instances.ts`, `src/server.ts`, `tsconfig.json`.

`main` currently ships an ESM TypeScript entrypoint that loads the instance manager and routes compiled under the new module layout. The PR replaces that bootstrap with a different TypeScript stack that wires a runtime context, custom middleware, and new helper modules, so Git cannot auto-merge the two versions of `src/server.ts`. Likewise, the PR introduces its own `src/routes/instances.ts` that depends on the new context helpers, while `main` expects the existing functions exported from `instanceManager` with ESM-style imports, so the route implementations clash. Configuration files also diverge: `main`'s `package.json` retains the ESM build pipeline (`type: "module"`, `dist/src/server.js` entry, `tsx` dev script) whereas the PR switches back to a CommonJS output and `ts-node` tooling, creating incompatible metadata in `package.json` and the lockfile. Finally, `main`'s `tsconfig.json` targets `ES2022` modules, while the PR demands a CommonJS build with `allowJs`, so the compiler options conflict line-by-line. Resolving PR #6 would require reconciling the two TypeScript setups or migrating the new runtime constructs onto the existing ESM conventions.

### PR #7 — Add Baileys boot services for messaging and polls

*Conflicting files:* `package.json`, `package-lock.json`, `server.js`, `src/instanceManager.js`, `src/routes/instances.js`, `src/utils.ts`, `src/whatsapp.js`, `tsconfig.json`.

This PR keeps the old CommonJS surface (`server.js`) and Baileys runtime in JavaScript, while `main` deleted those files in favour of TypeScript equivalents, so Git reports modify/delete conflicts for each runtime module (`server.js`, `src/instanceManager.js`, `src/routes/instances.js`, `src/whatsapp.js`). At the same time, `main` relies on `src/utils.ts` to expose rate limiting and metrics helpers, but PR #7 deletes that file in favour of its legacy `utils.js`, creating a direct content conflict and breaking the TypeScript pipeline that other modules reference. Similar to PR #6, the manifest and TypeScript config revert to CommonJS defaults with different dependencies (e.g., adding `ts-node` and downgrading Express), which clashes with `main`'s ESM-based configuration. Any merge would need a unified decision between the legacy CommonJS architecture proposed here and the ESM TypeScript stack already merged into `main`.

### PR #8 — Refactor to single Baileys context

*Conflicting files:* `server.js`, `src/routes/instances.js`, `src/whatsapp.js`.

PR #8 aims to simplify Baileys state management by editing the same CommonJS files that `main` recently removed when migrating to TypeScript (`server.js`, `src/routes/instances.js`, `src/whatsapp.js`). Because those files no longer exist on `main`, the merge registers modify/delete conflicts and leaves the PR versions in place, but they are incompatible with the TypeScript modules (`src/server.ts`, `src/routes/instances.ts`) that the runtime now expects. Integrating the PR would therefore require porting the single-context idea onto the new TypeScript modules instead of restoring the obsolete CommonJS files.
